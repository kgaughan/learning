A sudoku__ solver using priority queues. This popped into my head a potentially
effective way to solve it. Not sure if it's the most efficient way, but it
seemed like an interesting exercise.

For more difficult variants where the queue might end up with elements on its
head that might have more than one solution, I'll probably have to implement
some kind of backtracking mechanism, but my initial solution won't have it.
