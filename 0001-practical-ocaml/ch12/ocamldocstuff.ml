(** {1 This is a section header}
    {b Here is some bold text} with examples of
    {i italics} and {e emphasised} text, too.
    {C We can centre}
    {L left-align} {R and right-align too}
  
    We can reference code with links like this: {!Docoff.Docoff.bar}.
    Notice that it has to be fully qualified.
  
    Source code can be inlined like this:
    [val source_code_style: string -> int]
  
    Or preformatted like this:
    {[ let source_code_string x = String.length x;; ]}
  
    {v Verbatim text can be added, though you
may still have to escape certain text in verbatim blocks. v}
    {{:http://www.slashdot.org} this text can be a link}
  
    We can also make L{_a}T{^e}X look (almost) correct.
