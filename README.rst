There are a few things I want to brush up on, so I'm going to start going
through a few books I own, re-read them, do the exercises, and take notes
as I go along.

This is a little more structured than the way I usually do things, but I
think the exercise will be worthwhile.

I'll also keep a note of the books in question and the dates I start them
on here.
