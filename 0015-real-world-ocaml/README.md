# Read World OCaml, first edition

Please note that anything from before chapter 4 is bound to break if you run it these days, as the first edition depends on a version of the Core and Base libraries that are now obsolete.

I've started a series of posts in my blog that attempt to note any stumbling blocks present in the first edition for those using it with more recent versions of Jane Street's alternative standard libraries and tooling. [The first post covers getting started](https://keith.gaughan.ie/rwocaml-1.html) and should cover most of the major issues you might run into.
